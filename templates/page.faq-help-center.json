The estimated delivery shown reflects the shipping time once your item reaches our warehouse.<\/p><p>The Restock Date posted on the product detail page is when we reasonably expect to have the product in stock based on anticipated demand, communications from the manufacturer, and other factors. The estimated time of arrival (ETA) date advised is the time required for the order to be delivered to our distribution center. These dates are good faith estimates and subject to delays or changes. You may cancel an order at any time before shipment. <\/p><p>If we email you a tracking number during the day, the information may not post to the carrier's website until that evening. <\/p><p>Business days are defined as Monday to Friday, excluding holidays.<\/p>",
